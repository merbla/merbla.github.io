      <description>Recently I had to setup a static web site on Azure. At the time I was using an Azure Web App with a rudimentary GitHub deployment. Once setup, the next stage was to add SSL and I wanted to use Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt. I stumbled over to the Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt Site Extension mentioned in the gooroo blog.
Most of my time these days is spent on OSX and Docker and I generally use a Docker Container to isolate accounts when using cloud services such as Azure and AWS.</description>

      <description>Recently I have been doing a lot of work getting teams comfortable with Cloud solutions. In a certain case, the visibility into what changes were made to an Azure subscription became a paramount requirement. Recently the Azure Preview Portal has added an Audit blade, so the question was&amp;hellip; How does one get this info and distribute to others?

I asked around about how to extract this info and Paul Bouwer sent me this link</description>
