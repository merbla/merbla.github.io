      <description>Following on from my initial post here a some quick notes on the Serilog Console Sink.
This sink has a varied history, originally packaged with the Serilog library. It was split out during the great sink split of 2015, and at that time the features were split into two projects namely the Console Sink and the Coloured Console Sink. Soon after Nick introduced the Literate Console Sink inspired by literate programming.</description>

      <description>Serilog has been around for some time and since then the ecosystem has grown and been developed behind a fantasic community and the leadership of Nick. I have been lucky enough to be involved for some time as a co-owner of Serilog however I still find myself forgetting key areas of the platform.
As as a result, I thought I start a series of posts addressing areas that are commonly asked about either in our Gitter Channel, on GitHub or elsewhere.</description>

      <description>I have spoken to many people over recent years about their use of Serilog and how it helps their development. One of the most common issues I encounter when people are starting out, relates to the Hello World console app.
Someone may start out with a simple example using the Literate sink such as the code below.
static void Main(string[] args) { Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration() .WriteTo.LiterateConsole() .CreateLogger(); Log.Information(&amp;quot;Hello World.</description>

      <title>DotNet Core RC2, Splunk and Serilog</title>

      <description>Over at Serilog, we have been busy over the last few months getting the library ready for the next release of DotNet.
After some changes to the core library it was time to move our attention to the sinks and enrichers.
The Splunk sink is now available with RC2 compatibility.
The packages are Serilog.Sinks.Splunk 2.0.0-rc-xxx and can be sourced from NuGet.
This now means you can use DotNet, Serilog and Splunk via the HTTP Event Collector on a wide range of platforms.</description>

      <title>Serilog and Splunk 6.3 - The Event Collector Sink</title>

      <description>Recently I had the privilege of attending and speaking at Splunk .conf. During the keynote a major announcement was made relating to the way you can get data into Splunk. The new HTTP Event Collector announced in Splunk 6.3 allows for so many new ways of publishing data from IoT, Cloud, pretty much anything that understands HTTP.
So of course that means an update of the Serilog sink was required.</description>

      <description>Over the last couple of years, like most in software I have become more and more involved with the &amp;ldquo;DevOps&amp;rdquo; landscape. One product that has been a great help when working with the IoT is Splunk. In my opinion, when dealing with distributed systems that utilise many devices and operating systems, the architecture of Splunk simply stacks up. This post will not go into the details of how Splunk works, rather how you can start utilising it in the world of .</description>
