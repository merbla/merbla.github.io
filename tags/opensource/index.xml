This is the next instalment of series of posts related to building your our Open Source app for [Splunk](). My initial thoughts are over here, and I hope to structure the series as follows:
 [Part 1 - Setting up a repository and build on Github for a Splunk app](). Part 2 - Getting data into Splunk via an AddOn/Modular Input Part 3 - Securing credentials for an AddOn/Modular Input Part 4 - Dashboards Redux Part 5 - Deployment Considerations Part 6 - Splunk App Certification  Getting Started Many people would probably start hacking away at this point, however I thought I would take a step back and tackle this from a quality point of view.</description>
