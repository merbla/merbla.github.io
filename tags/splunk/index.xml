This is the next instalment of series of posts related to building your our Open Source app for [Splunk](). My initial thoughts are over here, and I hope to structure the series as follows:
 [Part 1 - Setting up a repository and build on Github for a Splunk app](). Part 2 - Getting data into Splunk via an AddOn/Modular Input Part 3 - Securing credentials for an AddOn/Modular Input Part 4 - Dashboards Redux Part 5 - Deployment Considerations Part 6 - Splunk App Certification  Getting Started Many people would probably start hacking away at this point, however I thought I would take a step back and tackle this from a quality point of view.</description>

      <description>Over 12 months ago, I released a cutdown version of a Splunk App that targeted Octopus Deploy. I was stoked when I won an award at .conf 2015.
Since then I have been able to work with a great crew such as Grigori Melnik, Andy Nortrup, Logan, David P. plus many more to release Splunk AppInspect.
Also, I have had more and more questions and queries about running the Octopus Deploy app in a distributed Splunk environment.</description>

      <title>DotNet Core RC2, Splunk and Serilog</title>

      <description>Over at Serilog, we have been busy over the last few months getting the library ready for the next release of DotNet.
After some changes to the core library it was time to move our attention to the sinks and enrichers.
The Splunk sink is now available with RC2 compatibility.
The packages are Serilog.Sinks.Splunk 2.0.0-rc-xxx and can be sourced from NuGet.
This now means you can use DotNet, Serilog and Splunk via the HTTP Event Collector on a wide range of platforms.</description>

      <description> Recently I had to revisit an old deployment with Octopus Deploy, and it had been a while&amp;hellip;. I had a requirement to log what was going on to a Splunk instance. Realising I had not shared some previous code, I threw together an Octopus Deploy Step Template for the Splunk Event Collector.
It is easy to setup&amp;hellip;
And easy to query in Splunk&amp;hellip; Get Amongst It!! </description>

      <title>Serilog and Splunk 6.3 - The Event Collector Sink</title>

      <description>Recently I had the privilege of attending and speaking at Splunk .conf. During the keynote a major announcement was made relating to the way you can get data into Splunk. The new HTTP Event Collector announced in Splunk 6.3 allows for so many new ways of publishing data from IoT, Cloud, pretty much anything that understands HTTP.
So of course that means an update of the Serilog sink was required.</description>

      <title>Introducing the Splunk Add-On for Octopus Deploy</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s no secret to those who know me well, I enjoy the delight of a seamless deployment. The team over at Octopus Deploy have toiled for a number of years developing a tool and educating the wider .Net community about the benefits of a repeatable deployment.
Another aspect of tech I love, is structured logging. In particular the detailed visibility it provides into our solutions and what they are really up to.</description>

      <description>Over the last couple of years, like most in software I have become more and more involved with the &amp;ldquo;DevOps&amp;rdquo; landscape. One product that has been a great help when working with the IoT is Splunk. In my opinion, when dealing with distributed systems that utilise many devices and operating systems, the architecture of Splunk simply stacks up. This post will not go into the details of how Splunk works, rather how you can start utilising it in the world of .</description>
