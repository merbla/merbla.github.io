      <description>I have had a few questions recently about how to setup Docker with Serilog and Splunk when logging to a file. Generally I opt to use the HTTP Event Collector however there are some situations that warrant logging to a file.
A simple way to get logging out via a file to Splunk in Docker is via a shared volume. As I mentioned I can think of better production approaches however here is some quick setups to get up and running.</description>

      <description>This is the next post in a series re-discovering Serilog v2.
Recently, the new HTTP Client Factory was announced as apart of the ASP.NET Core 2.1 release. There have been a number of posts relating to how it can be hooked with ASP.Net.
 ASP.NET Core 2.1-preview1: Introducing HTTPClient factory HttpClientFactory for typed HttpClient instances in ASP.NET Core 2.1  In this post, I wanted to illustrate how you can use this new package whilst swapping in Serilog&amp;rsquo;s superior logging capabilites.</description>

      <description>This is the next post in a series re-discovering Serilog v2.
In this post, ASP.Net Core will be the focus. Along with .Net Core, ASP.Net Core has experienced significant changes over the past few years. As such Serilog has adapted accordingly.
In this post, tooling is as follows.

      <description>This is the next post in a series re-discovering Serilog v2.
In the introduction to the Serilog Console Sink I mentioned about how you can use a number of ways to configure Serilog. Below is a simple guide on which approach you may like to take when setting up your configuration.

      <description>Following on from my initial post here a some quick notes on the Serilog Console Sink.
This sink has a varied history, originally packaged with the Serilog library. It was split out during the great sink split of 2015, and at that time the features were split into two projects namely the Console Sink and the Coloured Console Sink. Soon after Nick introduced the Literate Console Sink inspired by literate programming.</description>

      <description>Serilog has been around for some time and since then the ecosystem has grown and been developed behind a fantasic community and the leadership of Nick. I have been lucky enough to be involved for some time as a co-owner of Serilog however I still find myself forgetting key areas of the platform.
As as a result, I thought I start a series of posts addressing areas that are commonly asked about either in our Gitter Channel, on GitHub or elsewhere.</description>
