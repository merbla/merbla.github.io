      <description>Serilog has been around for some time and since then the ecosystem has grown and been developed behind a fantasic community and the leadership of Nick. I have been lucky enough to be involved for some time as a co-owner of Serilog however I still find myself forgetting key areas of the platform.
As as a result, I thought I start a series of posts addressing areas that are commonly asked about either in our Gitter Channel, on GitHub or elsewhere.</description>
