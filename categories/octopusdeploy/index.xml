      <description>Over 12 months ago, I released a cutdown version of a Splunk App that targeted Octopus Deploy. I was stoked when I won an award at .conf 2015.
Since then I have been able to work with a great crew such as Grigori Melnik, Andy Nortrup, Logan, David P. plus many more to release Splunk AppInspect.
Also, I have had more and more questions and queries about running the Octopus Deploy app in a distributed Splunk environment.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s no secret to those who know me well, I enjoy the delight of a seamless deployment. The team over at Octopus Deploy have toiled for a number of years developing a tool and educating the wider .Net community about the benefits of a repeatable deployment.
Another aspect of tech I love, is structured logging. In particular the detailed visibility it provides into our solutions and what they are really up to.</description>
